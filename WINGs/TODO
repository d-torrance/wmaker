Themes/texture stuff (+ other bugs that I've noticed while working on this)
===========================================================================
- Move typedefs to WINGsP.h
- Do we need all the defines in WINGs.h?  Maybe move some back to
   wtexture.c
- defines to enums
- Use more WINGs-y names, e.g., WMTexture
- Move over parse_texture from src/defaults.c
- More descriptive variables in WINGs.h declarations
- Use existing WINGs reliefs instead of WREL_*.  (This might require
   adding some new bevels to libwraster.)
- The first time we look up a pixmap, store the Window Maker pixmap
   paths, merging user + global (static).
- wconfig.h's default pixmap/icon path #defines don't match the ones
   given in the default WindowMaker file.
- can't find system icons when running from strange installation
   directory (possibly related to wconfig.h problem above)
- Add WMSetWidgetBackgroundTexture function
- Once the above is ready, submit patches

- Then begin theming.
===========================================================================

- move paint to idle handlers
- check if its useful to add some WMBrowserSelectionDidChangeNotification
  (actually a pass-through for WMListSelectionDidChangeNotification).
  Or a delegate to be called when the list selection change.
- add some way to modify speed when scrolling WMList, depending on how
  far the mouse is moved outside of the list.
- clean up header files of declared but not implemented anywhere functions
- implement a generic WMChangeFontAttribute(WMFont *font, enum attributes)
  function


- optimize color allocation for repeated colors
- make it work in 8bpp
- optimize SystemFont allocation for repeated font sizes
